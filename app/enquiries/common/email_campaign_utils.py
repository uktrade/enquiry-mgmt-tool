"""
This module handles the connection to Adobe Campaign, subscribing non responsive leads
to an email campaign. The campaign prompts leads to fill in a 2nd qualification form,
requesting  call back.
The process includes a few steps:

Process 1:
1. collect enquiries which are marked as Non Responsive.
2. For each one, subscribe the lead to the adobe campaign.
3. Collect a log of each such subscription to ensure the next run picks up from the
   last subscription

    Example:
    ```
    from app.enquiries.common.email_campaign_utils import process_latest_enquiries
    process_latest_enquiries()

    ```

Process 2:
1. Collect any submission to the 2nd qualification form via activity stream.
2. Update Adobe Campaign that the lead has completed the 2nd qualification form.

    Example:
    ```
    process_second_qualifications()
    ```
Process 3:
1. Collect any leads marked as engaged. Unsubscribe them from the adobe campaign.

    Example:
    ```
    process_engaged_enquiry()
    ```
